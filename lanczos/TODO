+ fix up the error estimation
+ wrap up in a function
+ make sure it works for both single and double
- make it run with OpenMP
    - having problems with the 
- make a cublas handle singleton
    - this needs some careful thought before implementation.
    - needs to be included as part of minlin.
- generalize BLAS level 2 and level 3 expressions into expression templates that call appropriate MKL/CUBLAS routines
    + done for matrix-vector multiply in development branch of minlin
    - have to add sub-matrix and strided vector references for gemv
    - have to add gemm functionality (should be straightforward given gemv implementation
