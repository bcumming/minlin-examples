to build:
> make driver

to run:
> aprun ./driver

the driver will load a matrix in test.mtx (has to be symmetric matrix market format). At the moment we have a small matrix, which won't utilize the GPU very effectively.

currently only nvcc can be used to compile (for both the host and device targets). To test the OpenMP backend for Thrust I want to use g++, however I haven't been able to do this after a bit of playing around (problems with __device__ etc in the header files, that I need a bit longer to get to the bottom of).
